<p>html means hypertext markup language </p>
<p>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, <strong>all paragraphs share certain</strong> characteristics. One of the most <em> important of these</em> is a <b><i> topic </i> </b>sentence.</p>

Heading: <h1>This is Heading H1</h1>
<h2>This is heading h2</h2>
<h3>This is heading h3</h3>
<h4>This is heading h4</h4>
<h5>This is heading h5</h5>
<h6>This is heading h6</h6>
<P><h1>The first publicly available description of HTML</h1> was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML</P>

Note:
<p>in line means in a line: strong, em, i, b, small, span</p>
block: p,h1, div,
<strong>This is Strong</strong>
<em>This is em/Emaphasize</em>
<span>This is Span</span>
<div>This is Divs</div>
<small>This is small</small>

<p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the <em>commands used</em> by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
